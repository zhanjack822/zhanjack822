I'm (Jack) Kuei Hung Zhang, a third year mathematical physics student at the University of Waterloo. 

I've worked as a software developer for Northern Digital Inc, and I also routinely program simulations for my physics courses. Right now,
I'm interested in creating fully fledged desktop applications for conducting simulations. I also want to expand my skillset, and am looking
to learn C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Julia through several personal projects

I also develop scenarios in Arma 3's sandbox for the user community to enjoy, and I will eventually migrate all of the SQF scripts I use to their own
repository as well.
